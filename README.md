# Mana Bug

Welcome to **Mana Bug** – a tool designed to enhance your gameplay in Magic: The Gathering Arena by calculating the most mana-efficient plays based on the current game state. 

## Overview

Mana Bug reads MTG Arena log files to determine the most mana-efficient moves available during gameplay. Effective mana management is crucial for success in Magic: The Gathering, and Mana Bug helps you make the most out of every mana point.

### Key Features:
- **Mana Efficiency Calculation**: Identifies the best plays based on current mana efficiency.
- **Automatic Log File Detection**: The app attempts to locate your log file automatically.
- **Manual Log File Path Configuration**: If automatic detection fails, you can set the log file path manually.

## How to Use

1. **Enable Detailed Logs**: Ensure that "detailed logs" are turned on in MTG Arena.
2. **Run Mana Bug**: Start the Mana Bug application.
3. **Log File Detection**: The app will attempt to locate your log file. If it fails, manually set the log file path.
4. **Start Analysis**: Click 'Start' to begin analyzing your log file and get mana-efficient play recommendations.

## Known Bugs

- **Large Log Files**: The log file can get very large and may slow down the operation of Mana Bug. If you encounter performance issues, try closing MTG Arena and reopening it to reset the log file.
